<img src="class.jpg" alt="Jordan Lin" style="width:50%;" height = 250>
<p style="font-size:30px;"> Hello, guys! My name is Jordan Lin, and I have created a couple of games that I wanted to share with you guys to commemorate what I've learned in CISGAME-420! I'll include not only what I learned in this class but also some games I've created with the knowledge I learned in this class! The games I have always loved to play RPG and fighting games in my childhood and because of that one of the video games that I made is a dungeon RPG that was made in Gamefroot! <br></p>

<p style="font-size:30px;">This class taught me much more than I would have initially thought. I walked into the class thinking that I would have learned only about how to program a game but I then realized that there is much more to game deveopment than just coding. I learned that I had to take into consideration what the market wanted, which game engines to even consider based on many factors of my desired game (ex: 2D games sometimes require different game engines than 3D games and different game engines utilize different programming languages), how to monetize my potential game, the competition that exists within the genre of my game, which tools and services to use when publishing and maintaining my game, and much more! I learned about various game engines like Unity, Gamefroot, and GameSalad and even learned how to hardcode my own game with only a JavaScript compiler! I will share with you two games that I've made: one that uses Gamefroot and the other that only uses a JavaScript compiler!<br></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:60px;"">Game #1: Save Princess Lux!</h2>
<img src="rpg.jpg" alt="Jordan Lin" style="width:47%;" height = 330>
<p style="font-size:30px;"> I made this game with my love for League of Legends in mind! This game was made with Gamefroot. In this game, you play as Prince Garen of Demacia. To complete it, you must save his kidnapped sister Princess Lux from the dungeon that the devil king Aatrox trapped her in. You use the arrow keys to move and the spacebar to swing your trusty sword at the enemies! <br></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:60px;"">Game #2: COVID-19 SImulator</h2>
<img src="sim.jpg" alt="Jordan Lin" style="width:45%;" height = 330>
<p style="font-size:30px;"> Here is a game that I made a variation off of a Gamefroot tutorial! In this game, you learn about how much of a positive impact that you can have on the pandemic by simply staying at home! <br></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:60px;"">Game #3: My Attempt at Recreating Snake</h2>
<img src="snake.jpg" alt="Jordan Lin" style="width:27%;" height = 370>
<p style="font-size:30px;"> Here is a Snake game that I made with JavaScript! Although it's a lot less interesting than the RPG game that I made with Gamefroot, it definitely was a lot more difficult to make since Gamefroot implemented a block-code system. You use the arrow keys to move the snake and like the original game you must grow the snake as long as possible (which is done by eating the blue pixel) without hitting the end of the screen or yourself. There are no sounds to this game, but it definitely plays like the old classic! <br></p>

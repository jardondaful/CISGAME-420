# CISGAME-420
These are the games and websites I have developed in Chaffey College's CISGAME-420 class in Spring 2021. Please do not try to copy or re-use any of my code for future classes. The purpose of this repository is to back up my work and to serve as a resource for self-education. The code/links to the websites and Gamefroot games that I have developed are in their respective folders

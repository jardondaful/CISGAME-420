<img src="oldleague.jfif" alt="Jordan Lin" style="width:50%;" height = 500>
<p style="font-size:30px;"> Hello, guys! My name is Jordan Lin, and I am here to talk about my favorite video game League of Legends! I have played this game since middle school and played a lot more of it since lockdown started to pass time and keep me sane. Although the game is straightforward in terms of its objective completing it is the exact opposite! <br></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:60px;""> Very Brief Overview of the Game</h2>

<p style="font-size:30px;">This game involves ten people. They will be split into two teams of five and each team will have a base to protect. To win the game, your team needs to destory the enemy team's turrets and nexus before your own team's base get's destroyed. Although the objective is straightforward, completeing it is most definitely not straightforward!</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:60px;"">The Roles You Can Play in the Game!</h2>
<img src="role map.jpg" alt="Jordan Lin" style="width:50%;" height = 370>
<p style="font-size:30px;"> Since there are five players on each team, there are five different roles in the game. They are the top laner (goes to the top lane), jungler (goes to the jungle), mid laner (goes to the mid lane), bot laner (goes to the bot lane), and support (also goes to the bot lane). The list below gives the description of each role<ul>
   <li style="color:black;font-size:30px">The top laner is usually responsible for soaking up damage for his/her teammates. Although the ones that win the most games always are tanky, some top laners like Quinn and Irelia can be squishy and still succeed! However, when playing these kinds of champions gaining a lead on your opponent top laner is extremely important and not doing so will result in you being essentially useless to your team.</li>
   <li style="color:black;font-size:30px"> The jungler is responsible for securing objectives like turrets and drakes for their team and helping them gain a lead against their oppoents. The jungler is special since unlike his/her other teammates he/she gains experience points through killing jungle monsters.They can succeed whether or not they are tanky but for the best results look at whether or not your teamates are squishy before making a decision on who you will play if you are playing this role.</li>
   <li style="color:black;font-size:30px">The mid laner is responsible for assassinating any out-of-position enemies as fast as possible. The mid laner has the most options in terms of choosing who to play since he/she does not have to worry as much about soaking up damage for his/her teammates but because of that they usually carry the most responsibility for the outcome of the game.</li>
   <li style="color:black;font-size:30px">The bot laner is responsible for dealing damage away from the front lines of battle. This role has the least flexibility in choosing who to play and is almost always the most susceptible to being assassinated due to damage output being more important then sustainability.</li>
   <li style="color:black;font-size:30px">The support is  responsible for mitigating damage from his/her teammates. Since the options for mitigating damage range from discouraging enemies from doing so by dealing damage to them to disabling enemies from attacking and healing your allies, supports can either be squishy or tanky. Again, for the best results, look at who your teammates are playing before choosing who you will play if you are playing support.</li>

<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:60px;""> Why I Love the Game So Much</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="champ.png" alt="Snow" style="height:35%" width = 500>

<p style="font-size:30px;">I like this game so much not only because of its uniqueness but also how you can try almost an infinite amount of things in this game. With five different roles and over 150 champions and 175 items in the game, I can always return to this game without the fear of being bored of it. Since it is more of a strategy game than a mechanics game, I can play this game when I'm tired from school without worrying about my fatigue affecting my performance. It also has tons of cosmetics that are avaliable for purchase for every champion in the game, which allows me to customize any champion to my liking. All of these factors was what made me put literally hundreds of hours into this game and I do not reget it (as seen from the last photo, one champion already has eleven different ways for the player to customize her!).</p>
